  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>I am (as of Spring 2025) a  pure mathematics student at the University of Toronto. 
    Right now, I'm working at <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/">Xanadu</a>, a quantum computing company located in Toronto, on fault-tolerant quantum algorithm research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this, I worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the theory of quantum algorithmic primitives, under the supervision of
      <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QKyb_9oAAAAJ&hl=en" style="color:red;"> Professor Isaac Chuang</a>, and before that 
      I was the first non-founding employee (although admittedly a less important one than subsequent hardware-genius hires) at <a href="https://extropic.ai">Extropic</a> (I took a gap year from 2022-2023 to do this).
    </p>

    <p>Outside of my primary job/education, I do research with <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DSgKHOQAAAAJ&hl=en">Professor Nathan Wiebe</a> on quantum algorithms.
        My mathematical interests are mostly geometric and topological in flavour. Right now, I am particularly interested in Hamiltonian systems, Lie algebroids, and K-theory.
         I also like to think about the synthesis of pure mathematics with fault-tolerant quantum algorithms and quantum simulation, as well as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PRjgI8kAAAAJ&hl=en">complexity</a>.

  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>I am (as of Spring 2025) a mathematical physicist, recently gaduated from University of Edinburgh with an MSc degree. Right now I am working as a private tutor for physics and math, as well as applying for PhDs. My recent interest is in Geometry and Topology, mainly their applications in physics.

    <h3> Research </h3>
    My most recent reserch project was of providing an easily comprehensible literature review for Penrose Singualrity theorem. Anyone familiar with some differential geometry should be easily able to follow the text and understand the elegant proof provided by Penrose.
